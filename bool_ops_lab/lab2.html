    <h2>Lab 2: Boolean Operations</h2>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Determine the order of operations for the boolean operators: <strong>and, or, not</strong>.</p>


<pre class="pybox">
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; not y and y
False
</pre>

<p>The python terminal code above proves that the boolean operator <strong>not</strong> has priority over <strong>and</strong>. This can be seen through the experiment above, if we assume <strong>and</strong> has priority then the expression y and y is evaluated first; simplifying the expression to not False. This would evaluate to True, which is contradictory to the experiment above, proving that the <strong>not</strong> operator has presidence over the <strong>and</strong> operator.</p>

<pre class="pybox">
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; y or y and x or x
True
</pre>

<p>Using the experiment above we proved that <strong>and</strong> has priority over <strong>or</strong>. This can be shown in the example above, if <strong>or</strong> has priority in the order of operations then the boolean expression above would evaluate to False. As we can see, the boolean expression above evaluates to True, meaning  <strong>and</strong> has presidence over <strong>or</strong>.</p>

<p>Now we have two conditions to determine the boolean order of operations.<strong>Condition 1:</strong> <strong>not</strong> must have presidence over <strong>and</strong>. <strong>Condition 2:</strong> and must have presidence over or. Using these two conditions we can derive the boolean order of operations: <strong>not, and, or</strong>, which is the only combination of boolean operators which will satisfy the conditions above. <strong>not, and, or</strong> is the correct order of operations!</p>
